# Gamble-Slot-Machine-using-Python
This is my independent project wherein my endeavor has been to create a Gamble slot machine that will allow the user to deposit an amount, bet some money and finally spin the roller in order to see if the user wins.
The user will then be able to view the updated balance and play further if they wish to.

## Learning Outcomes
There are few key concepts relating to creating new functions and calling them back used in this project.   
The random lib has been imported in order to make the spin random.
